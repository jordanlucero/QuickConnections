QuickConnections does not use delta responses due to the relative simplicity of the prompt that is passed to the Foundation Model. Instead, a transcript runs the prompt 10 times and includes any words that havenâ€™t been seen yet.

QuickConnections does not follow some best practices, as it is just a sample app. Requests may fail due to device rate limits, unavailability of Apple Intelligence, or device pressure.
